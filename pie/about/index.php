    <h1>About PIEB</h1>
    <article>
        <p>
            Pan Island Expressway Berhad (PIEB) was established on March 13, 2013 to construct and operate the Pan
            Island Expressway (PIE) on Pulau Tiong. The company has its headquarters at Beach Tower, Myna Town and is
            jointly owned by the Myna Town City Council (TCC) and M Construction Pte Ltd.
        </p>
        <p>
            PIEB has been awarded the concession to construct and operate the PIE on September 11, 2013. Construction
            has begun on February 17, 2014 and is scheduled to be completed in August 2016. Upon the completion and
            opening of the PIE, toll collection will begin after a two-month toll-free access period. Toll collection is
            imposed for 30 years or when the construction cost has been fully recovered, whichever occurs first.
